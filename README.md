open life tracker
=================
Track any personal or professional data in the browser. Track your health, the fuel usage or just use it as a diary with some spice. The graphs visualizes the data. It's offline only and uses localStorage. 

`#`Hashtags with `:values` enable you to track your progress or events on any topic in the chart: 

    Good running session #running #distance:12km  #duration:90min #heartbeats:85
    
    Doctor says it's a cold #sick #fever:37  

    Lasagne for lunch #food #calories:560 #carbohydrates:250g
